# Mock A/B Test Read-Out

This project simulates a daily data science artifact that is used for product decision-making. This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Run an A/B test using conversion as the metric of interest
- Test guardrail metrics to be sure product roll outs do not fall outside of buisness thresholds (session length, revenue)
- Apply statistical tests to measure within group differences (z-proportions, two sample t-test)
- Quantify effect sizes for statistically significant, negative impacts
- Produce a non-technical read out for project stakeholders

## Repo Structure
- `notebook.ipynb` - full analysis, including code snippets, charts + decision read-out memo
- `mock_ab_experiment.csv` - mock data set used for analysis, generated by AI

## Example Findings
- Conversion rates were significant for the experiment 10% -> 13%, +3pp, ~30% relative uplift
- Session length decreased ~1 minute (statistically significant, negligible effect size)
- Revenue showed no statistically significant differences

## Decision
- Recommended rollout based on conversion rates, monitor session length in proceeding days

## Requirements
Python 3.10+ with:

pandas
numpy
scipy
statsmodels
matplotlib
